# Trying to make coding a habit

I am new to HackerRank. I have learnt Python during my master course in "Foundation of Data Science", but I have never learnt it properly (from the basic).I found this HackerRank 30 days chanllege, and I thought "It seems fun, why not taking the challenge?". Then I came across to this github with 30 days challenge and some implementations in different programing languages, and I thought "why not do the same? Maybe... just maybe I will master Github after 30 days".   

So here I am!! 

The directories are numbered by the challenge. There should be a
readme, and potentially a script file of some sort to run, or compile
and run the code.

# 30 Days of Code

30 Days of Code is an opportunity for you to learn how to code or
brush up on your fundamentals. Each day, youâ€™ll unlock a new challenge
and a corresponding video tutorial to help you learn.

The tutorial is Java-based, but you can also choose other popular
languages to submit your solution. Topics include if-else statements,
recursion, data structures and more.
