## Objective 
Today we're expanding our knowledge of Strings and combining it with what we've already learned about loops. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task 
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

## Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer T,  (the number of test cases). 
Each line _i_ of the T subsequent lines contain a String, .

## Constraints

Output Format

For each String $S_j$ (where 0<=j<=T-1), print $S_j$'s even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by 's odd-indexed characters.
